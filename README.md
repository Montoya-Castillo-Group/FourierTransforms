# A pedagogical tour of the Fourier transform with applications to NMR and IR spectroscopy

Welcome to the **Fourier Transform Tutorial** repository, designed to help chemists understand the principles and applications of Fourier Transforms (FT) in NMR and IR spectroscopy. Using Python, this tutorial provides hands-on activities and guided notebooks that cover key FT concepts as applied to spectral data. Please visit this [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09619) to find the corresponding manuscript.


## Overview

This repository contains:
- Interactive activities and problem sets to explore FT concepts in spectroscopy.
- Sample FID (Free Induction Decay) data from a 2-butanone sample in CDClâ‚ƒ, collected on a Varian 500 MHz NMR spectrometer.
- Solutions to all activities for self-assessment and guided learning.

## File Structure

### Main Directory
- **Activity-Questions.pdf**: A PDF with questions to complement the interactive activities.
- **Prelab-Questions.pdf**: Pre-laboratory questions to introduce core FT concepts before beginning the main activities.

### Subdirectories

1. **FID_data_and_info**
   - **ascii-fid-MEK.txt**: ASCII format file of the FID signal for 2-butanone.
   - **Acquisition Parameters.png**: Image detailing the data acquisition parameters from the NMR experiment.

2. **activities**
   - **Prelab.ipynb**: A pre-lab notebook to familiarize users with Fourier Transform basics before starting the main activities.
   - **Activity_1.ipynb**, **Activity_2.ipynb**, **Activity_3.ipynb**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks for each activity, guiding users through FT applications in spectroscopy.
   - **Streamlined.ipynb**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks for each activity, combining the highlights of **Activity_1.ipynb** and **Activity_2.ipynb** with less emphasis on coding.

4. **keys**
